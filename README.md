# 🛡️ n8n AI Phishing Detector

An AI-powered Telegram bot built with **n8n** and **OpenAI** that analyzes incoming messages and estimates their phishing risk.

The bot returns:

* A phishing probability score
* A short explanation of the detected warning signs
* A simple and user-friendly Telegram response

## 🎥 Demo

## 🔄 How It Works

1. The user sends a message to the Telegram bot.
2. Telegram Trigger receives the incoming message.
3. The AI Agent sends the message to the OpenAI Chat Model.
4. The model evaluates common phishing indicators.
5. The bot returns the estimated phishing percentage and a short explanation.

## 🧠 Detection Indicators

The AI model considers indicators such as:

* Requests for passwords, OTPs, or card information
* Suspicious or shortened links
* Urgent calls to action
* Threats of account suspension
* Fake prizes or rewards
* Requests for money or sensitive information
* Impersonation of banks or trusted organizations
